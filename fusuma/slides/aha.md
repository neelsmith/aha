*but ALSO*...

- openly licensed, available for download in defined format



---

## Tweeting?

- frequency of issues: can't be explained in fiscal terms
- text: lengths
- widely circulated texts
- official, sanctioned contents




---


## Overview

Approach:  open license, defined format not limited to OLD environment

Look at timing of issues:

Look at *variety* of texts:  histo of normalized texts

Look at *libertas*

Look at dedicatory formulas

---

## Time of issues

> Question:  who strikes when?


- graph over time of # of issues

---

## Messages on issues



- graph of *distinct obv/rev legends* over time (by emperor?)

---

## Preparing a corpus

- enforce orthography
- expand abbreviations
- develop morphological parser
